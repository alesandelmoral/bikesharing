# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike data

The main poursope of this proyect is to analyze the NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, with Tableau and give relevant data for the bussines.

## Overview

We make another discoveries for the second analysis that can be seen [at this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alejandra.s.nchez.del.moral/viz/Challenge_16343553751940/NYCCitiBikeanalysis?publish=yes).

The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:

- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
- How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Results 

This graphing of number of trips by duration show that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length. More specifically, most trips are under a half-hour in length, with a swift dropoff in number of rides over an hour in length.

This breakdown of number of rides by duration, separated by gender, makes it even more apparent how many more rides are taken by male-identifying customers.

A heatmap also helps show weekly usage patterns. Once again we can see the heavy bike usage during weekday commute times, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day. An interesting anomaly is the relatively low bike usage during Wednesday's end-of-day commute. It could be useful to explore reasons for this (system outage, Wednesday holidays in August, something less obvious?), but it could just be an arbitrary anomaly. Also, we can still see that low-usage time in the early morning hours, every day of the week.

The last heatmap reinforces how much of the userbase is dominated by male-identifying, subscribing users. Why this is the case is unclear and warrants additional study.
